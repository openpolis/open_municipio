Can transparency work in italian _comuni_?
==========================================

*****
OpenMunicipio aims to bring transparency in the italian comuni.
It's a re-writing of the <a href="http://www.openpolis.it/progetti/openparlamento">OpenParlamento project</a>,
specifically targeted to municipalities institutions.

The project started in 2011 as a cooperation among
<a href="http://www.openpolis.it">Openpolis</a> and <a href="http://www.informaetica.it">Informaetica</a>.
